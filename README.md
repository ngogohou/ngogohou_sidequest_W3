## Description

This p5.js project demonstrates a simple multi-screen game structure using a state-based approach. The example includes a start screen, 2 paths screen with a back button, and an end screen.

---

## Setup and interaction notes

The game is a short interactive story that unfolds across four states.
On the start screen, the player is presented with two choices:
Press 1 to follow one narrative path
Press 2 to follow the alternate narrative path
In the middle states, the player advances the story by pressing Space.
On the ending screen, the player can press R to restart the story and explore a different path.

## Iteration notes

Post-Playtest:

- Explicit on-screen prompts (e.g., “Press 1 to explore” / “Press 2 to stay”) in each state to reduce confusion.
- Adjusted the color palette
- all mid-states advance using the same input (Space), making interaction more consistent and intuitive.

Post-Showcase:

- Visual Transitions Between States (fade-ins or short animated transitions between scenes to make the narrative flow feel smoother and more cohesive).
- additional branching states and multiple endings, allowing for more narrative depth and replayability.
